Extech PH testers have been mentioned as well as Milwaukee as being reliable.

Purchase a pneumatic sealing lid - a pump and sealing tube ensures that wine doesn't come into contact with oxygen.

Buy [PH meter](https://www.angelhomebrew.co.uk/en/all-test-products/412-beverage-doctor-pen-style-digital-ph-meter.html) (Â£20) to keep a constant eye on the PH level and to know exactly how much SO2 to add.
